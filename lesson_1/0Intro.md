### About this Course

- JS course for those who have already programmed in another language
- specifics of JS rather than programming in general
  - Langauge, grammar, data types
  - Functions and Higher-order functions
  - Arrays and Objects as data structures
  - Core built-in Methods
  - Writing idiomatic and stylistic code

### JS versions

- JavaScript is officially known as ECMAScript
- As of March 2020 the current specification is ECMAScript 2019 version 10 (aka ES10)
- ECMAScript 2015 ES6 was a huge improvement in how we use JavaScript
- We refer to modern JavaScript as ES6+
-  Use tools like [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) to transpile modern JS to run in browsers that don't support those features
- **You must learn both modern and traditional JS because many existing codebases still use ES5 code**
  - We will learn JS ES6+ features but only for those that are widely supported. 
  - We will learn traditional JS features too such as `var` and hoisting
  - **Use a [compatibility table](http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es2016plus/) to figure out what browsers support what features as older browsers don't support all of ES6 features** 
- Chrome has the best support for modern JS features, with Firefox in 2nd place. Microsoft browsers are the least supportive. Mobile device support is often good but sometimes lacking
